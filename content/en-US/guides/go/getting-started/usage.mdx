### Step 2: Create a Script

#### Create a Script in the Workspace Detail Page
  - When creating a blank Workspace, the details page is empty.
    1. Click the **＋** button next to **Script** to create a blank Script.
    2. In the creation panel, enter a **Script Name**. Click **Script Type** to choose between two different types of Scripts:
      - **Client Script**: Custom UI components, event handling, page interactions, etc.
      - **Server Script**: Connect to AI agents, databases, and other applications.
        | Workspace | Create Script |
        |---|---|

  - When using a template for the Workspace, the details page includes template Scripts.
        
    Click the **＋** button next to **Script** to create a blank Script.

  > The **Script Type** cannot be changed once created.

### Step 3: Run the Script

2. Once the code is written, click the **Preview** button in the top-right corner and select **Spreadsheet**.
  After selecting, a sheet document will open, and the results will be displayed within it.

3. When you click to run, multiple options will appear:
  - **onOpen**: Triggered automatically every time the Unit document is opened.
  - **onCreate**: Triggered automatically when the Unit document is created and opened, before **onOpen**.
  - **onClose**: Triggered automatically every time the Unit document is closed.
  - **myFunction**: Custom function name, which you can modify or extend based on your needs.

4. Click the corresponding option to run the script.
  - Both success and failure will show notifications.
  - The Workspace opened via the **Visit** button will not retain the document from the current run.
    | Success | Failure |

### Step 4: Click Visit

1. In the detail page, click **Visit**.
  1. This will open the corresponding Workspace homepage.

2. Create and delete documents on the homepage.
  1. Documents are only retained within the current Workspace.
  2. Deleting a Workspace in Univer Go will also delete the associated documents, and they cannot be recovered.
  3. Deleting a document from the homepage will not affect Univer Go.
