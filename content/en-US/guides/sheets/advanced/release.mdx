# Other Releases

> Experience the latest features and functionality while helping us test and improve Univer.

In addition to stable releases, Univer offers alpha / beta and nightly channels. These versions allow you to get early access to the newest features that have not been officially released yet. However, keep in mind that more features also mean more risks. These versions may contain bugs, incomplete functionality, or unstable features. Please avoid using these versions in production environments whenever possible.

## Alpha / Beta Release

When the Univer development team completes a new feature or significant change, they may pre-release it to the alpha or beta channel. You can install the alpha / beta version of a Univer package using the following command:

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @univerjs/<package-name>@alpha # Alpha version
npm install @univerjs/<package-name>@beta # Beta version
```

## Nightly Release

Nightly versions are automatically built versions of Univer, generated daily with the latest changes, bug fixes, and experimental features. These versions are highly unstable and not suitable for use in production environments. However, they are ideal for testing the latest features and ensuring compatibility with the most recent codebase.

```shell npm2yarn
npm install @univerjs/<package-name>@nightly
```

It is especially important to reiterate that nightly versions are extremely unstable and may contain fatal errors, incomplete features, or experimental functionality. Please **absolutely DO NOT** use these versions in production environments.

If you encounter any issues or have any feedback while using nightly versions, please report them to the Univer development team through appropriate channels, such as [Github Issues](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/issues) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/XPGnMBmpd6) community.

Happy early access experimentation!
