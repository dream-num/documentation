# Univer server Overview

For security, performance, and other considerations, some Univer features are implemented in the backend service. If you are using any of the following features, you need to deploy the Univer server to enable support:

- Printing
- Import & Export
- Collaborative Editing
- Live Share

The Univer backend service not only fulfills the above feature requirements but also supports integration with your own system to enable more capabilities, such as:

- User authentication: Only users in your system can access Univer services.
- Permission management: Control which user or user group can edit, read, export, etc.
- User workspace management
- Notifications: You can listen to events triggered by Univer. For example, when a user @mentions someone in a document comment, you can send a notification to the mentioned user via email or IM.
