# Event synchronization mechanism

The event synchronization mechanism provides a channel for publishing events that occur within the collaborative engine. The client system can consume these events and combine them with its own business to take the next step.

**How to use event synchronization mechanism?**

Currently supported for collaborative event synchronization:

- Collaborative editing: changeset successfully stored

## How to use event synchronization mechanism

Starting to use the event synchronization mechanism is very simple.

1. Turn on event synchronization switch
2. Initiate Consumer Event

### Turn on event synchronization

Add these configs below to your customer config file, go to [Deploy to product environment(/guides/sheets/pro-features/server/deploy) to learn how to apply customer configs.

<Tabs items={['docker compose', 'k8s']}>
  <Tabs.Tab label="docker compose">
  add this to your .env.custom
  ```properties
  EVENT_SYNC=true  # true for turn on
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab label="k8s">
  add this to your values.yaml
  ```yaml
  universer:
    config:
      rabbitmq:
        eventSync: true  # true for turn on
  ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Code Snippet for consumer

## Data structures

```go
message EventSyncData {
  string eventId = 1;
  string eventType = 2; // type of event, now support changeset
  int32 createdAt = 3;
  oneof event {
    univer.ChangesetAck csAckEvent = 4;
    // more event types in the future.
  }
}

message ChangesetAck {
  univer.Changeset cs = 1;
}

message Changeset {
  string unitID = 1; // unitID of the Univer document
  univer.constants.UniverType type = 2;
  int32 baseRev = 3;
  int32 revision = 4;
  string userID = 5;
  repeated Mutation mutations = 6;
  string memberID = 7;
}

message Mutation {
  string id = 1; // ID of the mutation
  string data = 2; // serialized params
}
```
