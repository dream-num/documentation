# Introduction to Pro Features

Univer's core framework and many basic features are [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/dream-num/univer), and are licensed under the Apache-2.0 license for free use by individuals and organizations. At the same time, we provide a series of pro features for enterprise users, including: 

- Pivot Table
- Print
- Import and Export
- Collaborative Editing (including collaborative cursors and history)
- Live Share

and so on, these features will be marked with <span className="mr-2"><ProTag /></span> in the documentation.

Pro features are based on the Univer commercial license agreement, which can be used for free, but there are some restrictions[^1]. If you need to unlock restrictions, you can contact our sales team to purchase a license. You can learn whether you need a license, how to obtain and use a license in the [License](/guides/sheets/pro-features/license) chapter.
