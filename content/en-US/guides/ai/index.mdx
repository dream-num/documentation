# Introduction to Univer AI

Welcome to the Univer AI documentation!  

## What is Univer AI?  

Univer AI is an independent product under the Univer brand, integrating Univer Space with AI (LLM). By leveraging large language models, it helps users break down complex tasks and uses Univer Facade APIs to read and manipulate spreadsheets and other documents. It is designed for data analysis, work summaries, and experimental data processing.  

The main goal of Univer AI is to provide advanced data analysis capabilities, especially for handling large-scale Excel files. It can extract, summarize, and analyze key information, offering better performance than mainstream AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek. It also demonstrates AIâ€™s ability to operate spreadsheets and complete complex tasks.  

The interface follows an AI Chat-based design with a left sidebar for managing chats and a right panel for AI interaction. Users can upload Excel files, preview them, and make edits directly within the chat.
