# Introduction to Univer Docs

Welcome to the Univer Docs documentation!

## What is Univer Docs?

Univer is a full-stack framework to build productivity applications, and Univer Docs is the document component of Univer.

Univer Docs can both run in the browser and on the server (Node.js). It is designed to be highly flexible, extensible and customizable, and can be used to build a wide range of applications, from simple text entry to complex typesetting. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a team, Univer Docs can help you build powerful document-based applications quickly and easily.

## How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case. You can also checkout Univer Docs at the top of the sidebar.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To get started, check out the [Quick Start](/guides/docs/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Univer.

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and its ecosystem. 

If you are interested in running Univer on Node.js, you should also have a basic understanding of Node.js. 

If you would like to try Pro Features and deploy Univer Server, we recommend that you have a basic understanding of Linux, Docker and Docker Compose (or Kubernetes).

## Extend Univer Docs

Univer is designed to be highly extensible so you can shape it to fit your needs.
