# Internationalization

## Using Preset Locales

From version 0.1.13, Univer no longer includes any locales, all locales are provided by plugins.

If you need to manually add locales, you can refer to the following example, import the corresponding locale as needed and assemble it into an object to pass it to the `Univer` instance:

```typescript
import { createUniver, defaultTheme, LocaleType, merge } from '@univerjs/presets';
import { UniverDocsCorePreset } from '@univerjs/presets/preset-docs-core';
import UniverPresetDocsCoreEnUS from '@univerjs/presets/preset-docs-core/locales/en-US';

const { univerAPI } = createUniver({
  locale: LocaleType.ZH_CN,
  locales: {
    [LocaleType.ZH_CN]: merge(
      {},
      UniverPresetDocsCoreEnUS,
    ),
  },
  theme: defaultTheme,
  presets: [
    UniverDocsCorePreset(),
  ],
});
```

## Piecemeal Installation

From version 0.1.13, Univer no longer includes any locales, all locales are provided by plugins.

If you need to manually add locales, you can refer to the following example, import the corresponding locale as needed and assemble it into an object to pass it to the `Univer` instance:

```typescript
import { LocaleType, merge, Univer } from '@univerjs/core';
import { defaultTheme } from "@univerjs/design";
import DesignEnUS from '@univerjs/design/locale/en-US';
import UIEnUS from '@univerjs/ui/locale/en-US';
import DocsUIEnUS from '@univerjs/docs-ui/locale/en-US';

const univer = new Univer({
  theme: defaultTheme,
  locale: LocaleType.EN_US,
  locales: {
    [LocaleType.EN_US]: merge(
      {},
      DesignEnUS,
      UIEnUS,
      DocsUIEnUS,
    ),
  },
});
```

## Using Custom Locales

Univer also supports custom locales, you can assemble the locale object according to your needs and pass it to the `Univer` instance. The preset locales for reference are generally stored in the `<rootDir>/packages/<PLUGIN_NAME>/locale` directory.

```typescript
const univer = new Univer({
  theme: defaultTheme,
  locale: 'es-ES',
  locales: {
    'es-ES': {
      shortcut: {
        undo: 'Deshacer',
        redo: 'Rehacer',
      }
    },
  },
});
```
