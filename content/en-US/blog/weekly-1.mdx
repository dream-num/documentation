# Univer Weekly #1

Welcome to **Univer Weekly**! In this brand new series, we will bring you the latest news of Univer every week, sharing the progress, highlights, and updates of the project. We hope that through these contents, you can better understand, use, and actively participate in the development and growth of Univer!

## New Version of Univer SDK Released

Last weekend, we released version 0.5.2 of the OSS and Pro SDK, which added the mini-map feature and fixed some bugs. You can learn all the changes in our [changelog](https://www.univer.ai/en-US/changelog). Currently, Univer Sheet has basically implemented the main functions of spreadsheets. Welcome everyone to try it out and provide feedback to us. We will continue to improve the functions of spreadsheets according to everyone's needs in the following versions, and gradually introduce more components.

## Facade API Continuously Optimized

Recently, the Univer team has spent a lot of time improving the capabilities of the Facade API to enhance the development experience of Univer. We have made some progress in this area. We will gradually release these improvements starting from version 0.5.2, hoping to help developers better use Univer.

## React 19 Compatibility

Earlier this month, React released version 19.0.0. Univer generally uses the latest version of upstream dependencies. However, some users are still using versions of React before React 17. Compared with these versions, React 19 has many breaking updates. Therefore, this week we started the compatibility work for multiple versions of React, with the goal of providing a painless access experience for users staying on different versions of React. This work is expected to be completed next week.

Although Univer will try its best to support multiple versions of React, we still strongly recommend that you regularly upgrade your React (and other mainstream dependencies) versions to better compatibility with the community.

## Collaboration Stability

We have been committed to providing first-class collaborative editing experience for our commercial users. This month, we completed a systematic stress test, identified the factors that affect the stability of the collaboration system in typical scenarios, and will gradually solve these problems in the next few weeks.
