## Architecture

The UI base of Univer is designed based on the following diagram:

<UIArchitecture />

By combining different plugins, various functionalities and views are added to the base, ultimately forming a complete application.

## Design System

Univer's design system is built on Tailwind CSS, creating a series of design tokens that are reused by the rendering engine to ensure consistent styling between the rendering engine and the view layer. You can customize your application's styles by modifying these tokens, which are stored in the `@univerjs/themes` package.
