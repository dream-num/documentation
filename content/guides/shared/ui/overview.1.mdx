## Components

Univer uses React components to build the view layer, making it very easy for developers who also use React to either use Univer's components or register custom components. However, this does not mean you can only use React to create custom components; Univer also supports other frameworks, such as Vue (version 3.x) and Web Components.

All basic components are stored in the `@univerjs/design` package, and icon components are stored in the `@univerjs/icons` package. These components can also be used independently of Univer.

Custom components are often used in the following scenarios:

- Adding custom buttons in Ribbon / Context Menu
- Integrating custom components in Sidebar / Popup, etc.
- Replacing built-in components

We will provide detailed instructions on how to register and use custom components in the following chapters.
