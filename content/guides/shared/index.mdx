## Browser Compatibility

Univer is compiled with a target of Chrome 70, but this does not mean it fully supports all mainstream environments. We strive to ensure Univer works well in the following browsers and Node.js environments:

| Edge | Firefox | Chrome | Safari | Electron |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| >=70 | >=63 | >=70 | >=12.0 | >=5 |

If you encounter compatibility issues, please first try to resolve them using the appropriate polyfills. If the issue persists, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/issues/new/choose).

## Node.js Compatibility

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This only applies to running Univer in a Node.js environment and does not apply to cases where Univer is run in a browser using build tools based on Node.js.
</Callout>

Univer can run in a Node.js environment, supporting versions v18.17.0 and later.
