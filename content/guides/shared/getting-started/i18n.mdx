<Callout type="warning" title="Caution">
  Not all plugins include language packs. We will specify this in the documentation for each feature.
</Callout>

## Custom Language Packs

Univer also supports custom language packs. You can assemble a language pack object as needed and pass it to the `Univer` instance. The preset language packs are generally stored in the `<rootDir>/packages/<PLUGIN_NAME>/locale` directory.

```typescript
const univer = new Univer({
  locale: 'ja-JP',
  locales: {
    'ja-JP': {
      shortcut: {
        undo: '元に戻す',
        redo: 'やり直す',
      },
    },
  },
})
```
