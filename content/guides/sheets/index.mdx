## What is Univer Sheets

Univer is a full-stack framework to build productivity applications, and Univer Sheets is the spreadsheet component of Univer.

Univer Sheets can run in both the browser and on the server (Node.js). It is designed to be highly flexible, extensible, and customizable, allowing you to build a wide range of applications, from simple calculators to complex enterprise-level financial models. Whether you are an individual developer or part of a team, Univer Sheets can help you quickly and easily build powerful spreadsheet-based applications.

## Highlights

Univer Sheets now supports a wide range of features, including:

- **Basic spreadsheet features**: Create, edit, and delete cells, rows, and columns.
- **Formulas**: Calculate values in cells using formulas.
- **Number formatting**
- **Data validation and conditional formatting**

For more details, please refer to the pages under the [Features](/guides/sheets/features/core) section. The core and major features are open-sourced on [GitHub](

## How to Read the Documentation

On the left side of the screen, you’ll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case. You can also checkout Univer Docs at the top of the sidebar.

On the right side of the screen, you’ll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To get started, check out the [Quick Start](/guides/sheets/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on Univer.

To get the most out of our docs, it’s recommended that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and its ecosystem.

If you are interested in running Univer on Node.js, you should also have a basic understanding of Node.js.

If you would like to try Univer Pro and deploy Univer Server, we recommend that you have a basic understanding of Linux, Docker and Docker Compose (or Kubernetes).

## Extend Univer Sheets

Univer is designed to be highly extensible so you can shape it to fit your needs. We recommend reading the [Architecture](/guides/recipes/architecture/univer) section to understand the structure of Univer Sheets and how to extend it. You can also start with the [How to Write a CSV Import Plugin](/guides/recipes/practices/csv-import-plugin).
