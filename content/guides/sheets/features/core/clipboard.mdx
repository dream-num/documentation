title: Copy and Paste
---

<Callout type="warning" title="Firefox Compatibility Note">
  Firefox does not support `clipboard.readText()`, see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/readText). In this case, Univer can only retrieve clipboard content from the paste event, thus only supporting keyboard shortcut pasting.
</Callout>

Univer uses the Clipboard API to implement copy and paste functionality, supporting copying and pasting from external applications to Univer, from Univer to external applications, and between Univer Sheets.

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Context Requirement">
  Due to modern browser security policies, the Clipboard API can only be used in secure contexts (such as HTTPS).
</Callout>
