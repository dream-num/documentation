## Basic Concepts [#basic-concepts]

Before diving deeper into Univer, please read this document to understand the basic concepts of Univer, which will help you use Univer more smoothly.

The basic concepts include:

- Plugin
- Snapshot
- Command
- Facade API

### Plugins

All of Univer's features are provided by plugins, which are the basic building blocks of Univer. Multiple plugins combined together form a Univer application.

The responsibilities of plugins include:

1. Implementing features, such as `@univerjs/sheets-filter` provides filtering functionality.
2. Providing some basic capabilities, such as `@univerjs/engine-render` provides rendering capabilities.

You can combine Univer's plugins to customize a Univer application that meets your requirements and avoid loading unnecessary code. You can also extend Univer's functionality by writing plugins to meet personalized needs.

2. [Univer Architecture](/guides/recipes/architecture/univer) to learn more about Univer's architecture design.

### Snapshot

You need to load a snapshot in Univer to load a document. Each type of document provides its own snapshot format. Please refer to the above API documentation to learn how to write a snapshot that meets the format requirements:

1. The snapshot format of a spreadsheet is [`IWorkbookData`](/guides/sheets/model/workbook-data#iworkbookdata).
2. The snapshot format of a document is [`IDocumentData`](https://reference.univer.ai/en-US/interfaces/IDocumentData).

Functional plugins can store resources, such as images, etc., through the `resources` field. For more information, see [Plugin Custom Model](/guides/recipes/tutorials/custom-model).

<Callout type="warning" title="Caution">
  Note! Univer's snapshot is only used to store data. It does not reflect the latest document status at runtime! If you want to save the document status as a snapshot, use the method to save the snapshot on the Facade API.
</Callout>

### Command

In Univer, all data modifications need to be executed through commands. The command-based approach can better track changes in values, implement functions such as undo, redo, and collaborative editing, handle complex associated logic between functions, etc.

If you want to modify document data through commands, please refer to [How to Find Command ID](/guides/recipes/practices/find-the-command-id). If you choose to modify document data through the Facade API, the Facade API will actually prepare parameters for you and execute commands behind the scenes.

<Callout type="warning" title="Caution">
  **Do not modify the snapshot directly!** This will not take effect and will not trigger the update of views or UI. Please modify data through commands or the Facade API.
</Callout>

### Facade API

Due to the high complexity of office applications, Univer's architecture is also very complex. To make it easier for developers to use Univer, we provide the Facade API, which is a wrapper for Univer's first-party plugins, providing simpler interfaces that make it easier for developers to use Univer.

We are improving the Facade API. Stay tuned for more updates. If you have any questions or requirements, please submit an issue on GitHub.

Of course, everything comes with a price. The Facade API is a high-level API that abstracts the underlying details. If you need to implement some complex features, you may need to understand Univer's architecture and use the low-level API directly.
