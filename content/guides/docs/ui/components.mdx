Univer does not directly pass components as parameters to any rendering functions. You need to register the components with Univer through the Facade API before you can use them in various mounting points.

If you are not familiar with how to obtain an instance of the Facade API, you can refer to [Facade API](/en-US/guides/docs/getting-started/facade).
