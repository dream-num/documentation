### Quick Start

If you need a scaffold project to get started quickly, we have prepared a [Univer Pro Start Kit](https://github.com/dream-num/univer-pro-sheet-start-kit) that allows you to quickly create a Univer Pro project with the following commands:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>
    The following commands require your device to have `nodejs >= 18`, `npm >= 8`, and `git` installed.

    ```bash
    npx degit dream-num/univer-pro-sheet-start-kit univer-pro-sheet-start-kit
    cd univer-pro-sheet-start-kit
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    The following commands require your device to have `nodejs >= 18`, `pnpm >= 7`, and `git` installed.

    ```bash
    pnpm dlx degit dream-num/univer-pro-sheet-start-kit univer-pro-sheet-start-kit
    cd univer-pro-sheet-start-kit
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  If the server is deployed on another machine, you need to change `localhost` in the `server` configuration in `vite.config.ts` to the corresponding machine's IP address.
</Callout>

ðŸŽ‰ If everything goes well, congratulations! You have successfully created a Univer Pro project integrated with the server. Visit http://localhost:5173/ to experience the advanced features and collaborative editing.
