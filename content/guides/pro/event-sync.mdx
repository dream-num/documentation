title: Event synchronization mechanism
---

The event synchronization mechanism provides a channel for publishing events that occur within the collaborative engine. The client system can consume these events and combine them with its own business to take the next step.

**How to use event synchronization mechanism?**

Currently supported for collaborative event synchronization:

- Collaborative editing: changeset successfully stored

## How to use event synchronization mechanism

Starting to use the event synchronization mechanism is very simple.

1. Turn on event synchronization switch
2. Initiate Consumer Event

### Turn on event synchronization

Add these configs below to your customer config file, go to [Deploy to product environment](/en-US/guides/pro/deploy) to learn how to add customer config file.

<Tabs items={['docker compose', 'K8s']}>
  <Tab label="docker compose">
    Write to the .env.custom file

    ```properties title=".env.custom"
    EVENT_SYNC=true # true for turn on
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="K8s">
    Write to the values.yaml file

    ```yaml title="values.yaml"
    universer:
      config:
        rabbitmq:
          eventSync: true # true for turn on
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Code Snippet for consumer

## Data structures

```go
message EventSyncData {
  string eventId = 1;
  string eventType = 2; // type of event, now support changeset
  int32 createdAt = 3;
  oneof event {
    univer.ChangesetAck csAckEvent = 4;
    // more event types in the future.
  }
}

message ChangesetAck {
  univer.Changeset cs = 1;
}

message Changeset {
  string unitID = 1; // unitID of the Univer document
  univer.constants.UniverType type = 2;
  int32 baseRev = 3;
  int32 revision = 4;
  string userID = 5;
  repeated Mutation mutations = 6;
  string memberID = 7;
}

message Mutation {
  string id = 1; // ID of the mutation
  string data = 2; // serialized params
}
```
