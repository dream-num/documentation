## Overview

The Univer team is excited to announce the release of version 0.9.3! This update not only introduces new language support contributed by our community, but also brings improvements to documentation interaction, multiple user experience optimizations, and a variety of important bug fixes. We're committed to making Univer more user-friendly and powerful with every release.

## Documentation Update

We're always focused on improving the developer experience. This week, we've added a brand new "Feedback" feature to our official documentation. Now, you can leave your suggestions and comments directly while reading the docs, helping us continuously refine and enhance our content. We truly value every user's input and will carefully consider all feedback to ensure our documentation meets real-world needs.

## Univer v0.9.3

### Internationalization: New Spanish & Catalan Language Support

Univer is now more accessible than ever! Special thanks to community contributor [@guillempuche](https://github.com/guillempuche) for adding Spanish (es-ES) and Catalan (ca-ES) language packs to Univer. We warmly welcome more developers to contribute additional language support, helping this open-source project reach a broader global audience.

### <span className="text-fd-muted-foreground">(Perhaps Not-So-)Breaking Changes</span>

In this release, the core logic of numfmt has been migrated to `@univerjs/core`, and as a result, we've officially removed the `@univerjs/engine-numfmt` package. For most users, this change will not impact your existing projects, as the package was only a secondary dependency. If you haven't installed it manually, no further action is required after upgrading. This adjustment helps reduce redundant dependencies and streamlines Univer's architecture for greater efficiency.

If you have previously installed this package, you can safely remove it with the following command:

```package-install
npm remove @univerjs/engine-numfmt
```

### Univer Server v0.9.3

Univer Server has fixed the issue of worksheet order confusion when exporting to XLSX, ensuring the accuracy of the exported data.

### Other Features and Fixes

- **Internal Dependency Upgrades**
  - `@wendellhu/redi` has been upgraded to v1.0.0. As Univer's core dependency injection (DI) library, the new version achieves 100% test coverage while maintaining high compatibility, allowing you to confidently extend and customize Univer.
- **Compatibility and Experience Optimizations**
  - Basic editing support has been added for mobile plugins, further enhancing usability and interaction on mobile devices.
  - The layout of the conditional formatting panel has been optimized for better appearance and consistency across different scenarios.
- **Data Validation and Interaction Fixes**
  - Fixed an issue where the data validation dropdown text was invisible in dark mode, improving usability for night/dark themes.
  - Resolved a problem where the `univerAPI.Event.SheetEditEnded` event was triggered before data changes when validating cell data through a popup, ensuring correct data flow. [See Issue #5525](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/issues/5525)
  - Fixed an issue where charts could not display correctly when the cell `t` value was not specified, ensuring the stability of chart components.
- **Other Fixes**
  - Fixed an issue with the history panel style in dark mode, ensuring a consistent appearance.
