## Overview

This week, we added a new chapter on [Lifecycle](/guides/sheets/getting-started/life-cycle) to the documentation and introduced guidance on how to [create UI adapters to support custom Vue 2.x components](https://docs.univer.ai/guides/sheets/ui/components#vue-2x).

Additionally, we released **Univer v0.9.2**, which primarily includes the new feature of filtering by color and introduces several practical Facade APIs.

## Documentation Updates

### Introduction to Lifecycle

The new [lifecycle chapter](/guides/sheets/getting-started/life-cycle) provides an overview of Univer's lifecycle design, explaining the meaning of different phases and how developers can leverage lifecycle events to control the timing of feature loading and execution. This chapter will help you identify the right moments to implement your business logic.

### Using Vue 2.x Components as Custom Components

Thanks to the UI adapter system introduced in version 0.9.1, you can now support Vue 2.x components by creating custom UI adapters. The documentation offers detailed steps and examples to help you get started quickly.

For more details, refer to [this guide](https://docs.univer.ai/guides/sheets/ui/components#vue-2x).

## Univer v0.9.2

### Filter by Color

Starting from v0.9.2, Univer Sheets Filter (`@univerjs/sheets-filter`, `@univerjs/sheets-filter-ui`) now supports filtering by color. This feature allows you to filter cell content based on color, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of data processing.

Simply select the desired color in the filter menu to apply the filter—no additional configuration is required.

### Facade API

The `@univerjs/sheets-drawing-ui/facade` package introduces the following new events and methods:

**New Events**

- `univerAPI.Event.BeforeFloatDomAdd`: Triggered before a floating DOM is added, allowing developers to customize actions beforehand.
- `univerAPI.Event.FloatDomAdded`: Triggered after a floating DOM is added, suitable for follow-up actions or state updates.
- `univerAPI.Event.BeforeFloatDomUpdate`: Triggered before a floating DOM is updated, allowing developers to customize actions beforehand.
- `univerAPI.Event.FloatDomUpdated`: Triggered after a floating DOM is updated, suitable for follow-up actions or state updates.
- `univerAPI.Event.BeforeFloatDomDelete`: Triggered before a floating DOM is deleted, allowing developers to customize actions beforehand.
- `univerAPI.Event.FloatDomDeleted`: Triggered after a floating DOM is deleted, suitable for follow-up actions or state updates.

**New FWorksheet Methods**

- `fWorksheet.getFloatDomById`: Retrieves information about a floating DOM by its ID, returning null if not found.
- `fWorksheet.getAllFloatDoms`: Retrieves an array of all floating DOMs within the current worksheet.
- `fWorksheet.updateFloatDom`: Updates the position and properties of a floating DOM by its ID, supporting chained calls.
- `fWorksheet.batchUpdateFloatDoms`: Batch updates the properties of multiple floating DOMs, supporting chained calls.
- `fWorksheet.removeFloatDom`: Removes a floating DOM by its ID, supporting chained calls.

### Univer Server v0.9.2

The export functionality of Univer Server has been enhanced to support exporting images embedded in cells and to fix issues related to broken hyperlinks during export.

### Other Features and Fixes

- **Internal Dependency Updates**
  - `@univerjs/icons` updated to v0.4.6, adding new icons <AIcon className="inline-flex" /> `<AIcon />` and  <BanIcon className="inline-flex" /> `<BanIcon />`.
  - `@wendellhu/redi` updated to v0.19.2.
- **Compatibility and User Experience Improvements**
  - Removed specific Vue version dependencies from the `@univerjs/ui-adapter-vue3` package.
  - Formula fixes and optimizations:
    - Fixed an issue where the `SUBTOTAL` formula did not ignore other `SUBTOTAL` calculation results.
    - Fixed rendering errors for `TRUE` and `FALSE` formulas.
    - Fixed an issue where formula selection areas could not be dragged while in formula editing mode.
  - Fixed layout issues in the custom sorting panel for Spanish language settings.
